This is the repository for my take-home assignment as part of an interviewing process. It contains a simple Streamlit app which demos the model developed by a fictional colleague. To run it yourself:
1. Fork the repo.
 host it on Streamlit Cloud. You will have to set up the OAuth 2.0 environments in Google Cloud and/or Microsoft Azure for yourself and configure the secrets.toml according to the Streamlit tutorial. Finally, add a line like `allowed_users = ["your@email.com"]` with your e-mail to the `[auth]` section.
